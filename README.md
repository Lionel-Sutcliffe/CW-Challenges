# CodeWars Coding Challenges

I've added a repository which includes most solutions (in IPYNB format) for CodeWars Challenges I've been working on in my free time.

You can find a complete list of my solutions here:

I'll be ordering my solutions by Kyus (Codewars' way of determining a challenge's difficulty)

I currently only program in Python, although I'd like to pick up R (again) eventually. I've done some easy challenges in JavaScript but for the time being I'm sticking with Python until I become proficient at it.

As of the time of writing I am ranked in the top 8.5th percentile of users on CodeWars and signed up in October of 2020, although I've just seriously started doing challenges regularly in January of 2021.
